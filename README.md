# Seixas-et-al-Influence-of-channel-width-on-stream-shade-and-temperature-change
This repository holds code used to extract riparian data for: Seixas, G.B., Beechie, T.J., Fogel, C., and Kiffney, P.M., Influence of channel width on stream shade and temperature change in a forested catchment, submitted to JAWRA

The main script is RiparianDataExtraction.m. All other .m files are called from the main function. Also included is a Matlab data file (.mat) containing NHD-derived stream segment points for the Chehalis River basin in WA state, USA, that have been attributed with bankfull channel width. These data are required inputs. If you are using the codes in a different basin, you will have to generate your own attributed streamlines data (see paper text).
